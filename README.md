# Room Tinker
This app is a modified version of one of the apps you'll produce following Google's [Android Fundamentals](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-training/).
It uses the [Room persistence library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) (part of Android Jetpack) which seems to be the Google recommended way of persisting data to an internal SQLite database.

In addition to the create and list views, this app also contains a detail view accessed by tapping on one of the textviews in the list.
